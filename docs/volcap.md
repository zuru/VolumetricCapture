```

## Running the application
The application requires the availability of a `device repository file`, communication with the message broker (`broker_IP`, `broker_username`, `broker_password`) and additionally broadcasts a spawning message at a single network interface (`local_IP`).
However, its default values are set to `localhost` and the `volumetric/capture` username/password.
Details about the installation of the RabbitMQ message broker and the registration of the sensors in the device repository can be found at the [Configuration](../configure) section.
If the configuration has been set up as proposed, it will match the default arguments, and with the RabbitMQ installed on the workstation running **VolCap**, then a single `double-click` on the `volcap.exe` suffices.

# Workflow

## Preparation

1. ___Add each sensor to the device repository___
    * Plug the sensor on the workstation to add this connected device to the device repository (**note**: _only a single sensor must be connected each time_).
    * Follow the instructions on the device repository section of the [Configuration](../configure#usage) to register the sensor and add it in the `device_repository.json`.
    * Repeat for all the sensors you will be used (and for each new sensor).

_If the devices' intrinsic parameters are not saved in the device repository you will not be able to calibrate the system_
{: .label .label-yellow }

2. ___Starting the VolCap application___
    * First, make sure that the devices are plugged on the sensor processing units (_i.e._ Intel NUCs), and that each one of them, as well as the workstation, are connected to the network switch. 
    * When you first start the **VolCap** application (`volcap.exe`) it should connect automatically to the RabbitMQ broker running on the workstation (`localhost`).
    If that is not the case, or if the RabbitMQ broker is set up on a different IP, you can start **VolCap** using the respective command-line arguments:

    > ``volcap.exe -b <rabbit_mq_broker_local_ip> -u <rabbit_mq_username> -p <rabbit_mq_password>``

        <img src="../../assets/images/App/idle.png"/>
    </p>

    The GUI is divided in widgets. 
    Each widget is responsible for a different aspect of the application workflow.

## Application Workflow

![VolCapUsage](../assets/images/usage/usage_lr.png)

### 1. Connecting devices/sensors
    
When you first start the application, each of the registered devices (in the `device_repository.json`) should appear on the `Devices Widget` with its given user-friendly name.
From this widget you can connect all of the devices at once (`Connect All`), or connect each device separately (select, and `Connect`).
In addition, you can modify the devices' connection stream profile (`Stream`), parameters preset (`Preset`), or configure the master device when using HW sync (toggle next to `Connect All`). Specifically:

* **Connect single device**:

    In order to connect a single device you have to select which device to connect by clicking on the checkbox next to that device, and click the `Connect` button.
    If you want to connect all of the devices at once, you can click the `Connect All` Button.

    <p align="center">
        <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_connection_manager.png"/>
    </p>

* **Selecting the connection stream profile**.

    Stream profiles control the resolution of the color and the depth streams. 
    The available stream profiles are the following:

    * `RGB - HD, D - HD/2`: 
        > `1280 x 720` color &  `640 x 480`  (Intel RealSense 2.0) or `640 x 576` (Microsoft Kinect 4 Azure) depth resolution
    * `RGB - HD, D - HD/4`:
        > `1280 x 720` color & `320 x 180` (Intel RealSense 2.0) or `320 x 288` (Microsoft Kinect 4 Azure) depth resolution
    * `RGB - HD, D - HD/4`:
        > `640 x 360` color & `320 x 180` (Intel RealSense 2.0) or `320 x 288` (Microsoft Kinect 4 Azure) depth resolution

    If you have a slow connection, or if the network switch is not unmanaged you can select a profile with lower resolution than Full HD. 
    The default selected profile is `RGB - HD, D - HD/2` which has no problems with the recommended network switch for up to `6` K4A sensors.
    For reduced bandwidth in order to accomodate more devices, we recommend the `RGB - HD, D - HD/4` stream profile.

    <p align="center">
        <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_conn_man_profilepng.png"/>
    </p>

* **Set the master device for HW device synchronization**
    
    From the drop-down menu next to the `Connect All` Button, you can select which device will be the **Master** device in a Hardware sync scenario.
    In order to use hardware synchronization, you need to have the HW sync cables assembled and connected to the sensors in either daisy-chain or star configuration.
    More details can be found at the [Synchronization](../synchronization) section for the process itself, and for assembling the HW sync cables at the respective sections for the [Intel RealSense 2.0 D415](../hardware/rs2_hardware) and the [Microsoft Kinect 4 Azure](../hardware/k4a_hardware).

    <p align="center">
        <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_hw_syncpng.png"/>
    </p>

Finally, when all of the devices are connected, each device viewport as well as the parameters of all the other widgets should appear on screen.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../assets/images/App/connected.png"/>
</p>

For each device, their real-time bandwidth consumption is displayed, along a color picker that sets that device's color.

**Note**: Mousing over the names or icons in this widget displays a tooltip with the device's IP which is helpful when needing to access the mini-PC for troubleshooting (via remote desktop or TeamViewer). In addition, pressing `CTRL+C` when mousing over will copy the IP in the clipboard.

</p>

### 2. Parameterizing devices

The **VolCap** application aims to be as configurable as possible. Experienced users have the ability to modify the parameters of the connected devices, by using the `Remote Eye Configuration` widget.
You can modify a specific parameter for all the devices at once, or for each device separately.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_dev_param.png"/>
</p>

Each sensor comes with different configuration capabilities. An indicative list of parameters that can be modified are:

* `Color Exposure`
* `Color Gain`
* `Color Brightness`
* `Color Sharpness`
* `Color Hue`
* `Color Saturation`
* `Maximum Distance (Depth Sensor)`
* `Depth Exposure`
* `Depth Gain`
* `Laser Power`
* `set/unset Color Auto Exposure`
* `set/unset Depth Auto Exposure`

When modifying device parameters using the sliders in the widget, then by default the modification will be applied to all of the connected devices. 
In order to modify parameters of a specific device, you have to first click on colored buttons depicting each device. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_sep_dev_param.png"/>
</p>

Apart from the devices' parameters, users can also modify processing parameters.
These currently include compression settings (for color and depth) and depth filtering settings.
The latter are only available for the Intel RealSense 2.0 D415 devices.
For the former, `jpeg` compression parameters only apply to the `RGB - HD` stream profiles for the Kinect 4 Azure device.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_work_params.png"/>
</p>

More specifically:

* **Jpeg Compression** (Color stream compression): 
    * `Quality`: Modifies the quality of the color stream compression (higher value means higher quality)
* **Entropy Compression** (Depth stream compression):
    * `Method`: You can choose one of the following entropy compression methods:
        * `Blosc`
        * `Lz4`
        * `Lz4HC`
        * `Snappy`
        * `Zlib`
        * `Zstd`
    * `Level`: The level of compression (higher value means better compression)
    * `Shuffle`: `Byte` or `Bit`
* `Spatial Filter` (Depth Stream Spatial Filter):        
    > _Parameters correspond to those of the RealSense 2.0 SDK_.
* `Temporal Filter` (Depth Stream Temporal Filter):        
    > _Parameters correspond to those of the RealSense 2.0 SDK_.

### 3. Configuring the application's viewport

Various gizmos can be toggled (_i.e._ cropping bounding box, ground plane, etc.), as well as 3D stream visualization settings (device color or actual color for the point clouds, etc) from the `Viewport Control` widget.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_view_control.png"/>
</p>

### 4. Recording

Multi-view recordings (`Start`/`Stop`) and snapshots (`Snapshot`) are possible from the `Recording` widget.
You can select a name for the sequence or the snapshot you are going to capture, by typing the name that you desire in the text-field of each operation (`Record` or `Snapshot`) and by hitting `Enter`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_record.png"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../assets/images/vol_cap_wiki_record_names.png"/>
</p>

By hitting the `Start` button, the recording of the live streams begins.
By hitting the `Snapshot` button, only the current frame is saved.
The captured sequences and snapshots are saved in the `/Data` folder, in the directory in which the **VolCap** application is installed, while snapshots are saved in the `/Snapshots` folder.
Each recording/snapshot is saved in a folder with the current date/time encoded in `YY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss` format.

### 5. Synchronization

Before recording the sensor processing units and the workstation need to be place on a common _global_ timeline.
This ensures that even in this distributed sensor acquisition setting, we can replay the recordings without any desync issues.
For more information on how to perform this inter-device synchronization step, please see the [Synchronization](../synchronization) section.

### 6. Calibration

Similarly, prior to recording, the positions of the sensors need to be spatially aligned to enable volumetric data acquisition.
For more information on how to perform this inter-device calibration step, please see the [Calibration](../calibration/process) section.
